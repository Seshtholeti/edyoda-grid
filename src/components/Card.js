                    <p class="textsec">Cloud Computing is incredibly complex and how it works varies depending on the task and the algorithm used to accomplish it. However, at its core, a machine learning model is a computer looking at data and identifying patterns, and then using those insights to complete its assigned task more effectively. Any task that relies upon a set of data points or rules can be automated using machine learning.</p>
